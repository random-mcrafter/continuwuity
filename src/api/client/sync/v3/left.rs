	so we have to filter out the membership from `state`.

	NOTE: we are sending more information than synapse does in this scenario, because we always
	calculate `state` for initial syncs, even when the sync being performed is incremental.
	however, the specification does not forbid sending extraneous events in `state`.

	TODO: there is an additional bug at play here. sometimes `load_joined_room` syncs the `leave` event
	before `load_left_room` does, which means the `timeline` we sync immediately after a leave is empty.
	this shouldn't happen -- `timeline` should always include the `leave` event. this is probably
	a race condition with the membership state cache.
